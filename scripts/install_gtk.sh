# Installs LogoMotive's build dependencies: GTK4, SDL2, pkg-config, and
# on Linux a C toolchain (compiler + make).
#
# SDL2 is not optional despite this script's name -- the Makefile has
# required it since Phase 4's joystick input (see its own SDL_LIBS
# comment), so a gtk4-only install still fails at link on ui.c's SDL
# calls. It was missing here on macOS too, not just on Linux.
#
# The toolchain is here because leaving it out had a bad failure mode:
# the libraries would install cleanly, and 'make' would then die with
# "gcc: command not found" -- which reads as a broken project rather
# than a missing package, and at a point where the user reasonably
# believes setup already succeeded. It's a no-op on any machine that
# has built anything before.
#
# Package-manager detection rather than one script per platform: the
# Makefile and build.sh are already platform-neutral (plain
# pkg-config/gcc, no hardcoded paths), so this is the only file that
# needs to know what OS it's on. brew is probed first so that a Mac with
# some other package manager installed still takes the Homebrew path.

# MSYS2 (Windows) is checked FIRST, and specifically before the pacman
# branch further down, because MSYS2 ships pacman too. Without this the
# Arch branch matched on Windows and asked for the bare gtk4/sdl2
# package names, which don't exist in MSYS2's repositories -- every
# native package there carries an environment prefix. It failed with
# "target not found" having installed nothing, which reads as "this
# project doesn't support Windows" rather than "wrong package names".

# which is what decides both the prefix and the compiler, so it's a
