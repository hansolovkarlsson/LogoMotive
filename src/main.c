// pkg-config's own gtk4 libs pull in -mwindows, which marks the PE as
// GUI-subsystem (confirmed: objdump -p reports "Subsystem 00000002
// (Windows GUI)"). Windows deliberately does NOT give a GUI-subsystem
// process a console, even when a console is what launched it -- so
// GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE) comes back unset and every printf
// goes nowhere. The process still runs and still exits 0, which is what
// makes the symptom so confusing: `logomotive.exe --help` in cmd.exe
// completes silently.
//
// Redirection and pipes were never affected, because there the parent
// hands down a real file/pipe handle that the CRT is happy to write to
// -- which is exactly why this survived the first round of testing.
//
// AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS) borrows the launching console
// when there is one, and fails harmlessly when there isn't (launched
// from Explorer, or already owning a console), in which case a GUI run
// is unaffected.
//
// The ordering below is the subtle part. AttachConsole itself points
// any standard handle that ISN'T already set at the newly attached
// console, so asking about the handles afterwards cannot distinguish
// "the caller redirected this" from "the attach just filled it in".
// Each handle is therefore sampled BEFORE attaching, and only the ones
// the caller left unset get repointed at CONOUT$/CONIN$. Without that,

// yanked away from out.txt and sent to the console instead -- breaking
