// save/restore *swap* of the LogoApp fields find_var and every existing
// opcode still read/write directly (throw_requested/throw_tag/
// run_depth/current_turtle) -- not a rewrite of any of that code.
// Variable *scope* storage is a partial exception: since it now lives
// inside each agent's own `Vm` (see agent.h's own comment and
// MAX_VM_SCOPE_DEPTH in vm.h), it never needs copying at all -- an
// agent's own vm.scopes/vm.scope_depth are already private to it,
// simply by virtue of each Agent owning a separate Vm. Before an
// agent's own turn, its saved state is copied into app's shared
// fields; after, app's (possibly changed) values are copied back into
// the agent's own storage.
