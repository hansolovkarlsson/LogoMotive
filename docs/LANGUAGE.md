# Logo Language Reference

This documents the Logo dialect actually implemented in `src/main.c`, as of
the current build. It's a living document — update it in the same commit
whenever a language feature changes.

## Comments

```
; this whole line is a comment
FD 100 ; and so is everything after this semicolon
REPEAT 4 [
  FD 50 ; comments work inside blocks too
  RT 90
]
```

- `;` starts a comment that runs to the end of the line, recognized
  anywhere a token boundary falls — after a command, on its own line,
  inside a `REPEAT`/`IF`/`WHILE` block, between list elements.
- A `;` with no preceding whitespace (glued directly onto a word or
  `"`-literal, like `"hi;there`) is just an ordinary character, not a
  comment — a comment has to start at a token boundary, same as most
  languages.
- Because a comment consumes the rest of its line unconditionally, one
  placed *before* a list literal's closing `]` on the same line eats the
  `]` too (`PRINT [a b ; c]` never sees its closing bracket). Keep
  comments on their own line, or after a complete statement.

## Turtle model

- Turtle 0 starts at position `(250, 250)` facing angle `0`, pen down.
- Angle `0` points up (north); `RIGHT`/`RT` increases the angle (clockwise),
  `LEFT`/`LT` decreases it.
- `CLEAR`/`CS` erases all drawn lines and resets *every* turtle's position
  and angle to the start (pen state, pen color, and background color are
  all left unchanged).
- There's one shared canvas, but multiple turtles — see "Multiple turtles"
  below.

## Multiple turtles

```
TELL 1
FD 100
TELL 0
RT 90 FD 50
```

- Every drawing command (`FD`, `RT`, `SETXY`, `SETPENCOLOR`, `PENUP`,
  `ARC`, ...) acts on the **current turtle**. `TELL n` switches which
  turtle is current, creating it (at the default position/heading/pen
  state) the first time it's addressed. Turtle indices run `0` to `9`.
- A script that never calls `TELL` behaves exactly as if there were only
  ever one turtle — turtle `0` is created automatically and is current by
  default.
- All existing turtles are drawn on the canvas at once, each as its own
  triangle marker (all the same fixed green, regardless of pen color).
- `TELL` with an index outside `0`-`9` prints an error and leaves the
  current turtle unchanged.
- `WHO` outputs the current turtle's index — the one thing `TELL` sets
  but has no way to read back on its own.

## Turtle commands

| Command | Abbreviation | Argument | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FORWARD` | `FD` | expr | Move forward by `expr`, drawing if pen is down |
| `BACK` | `BK` | expr | Move backward by `expr` |
| `RIGHT` | `RT` | expr | Turn clockwise by `expr` degrees |
| `LEFT` | `LT` | expr | Turn counter-clockwise by `expr` degrees |
| `SETXY` | — | `x y` | Jump directly to an absolute position, drawing if pen is down; heading unchanged |
| `SETX` | — | expr | Jump to a new x, leaving y unchanged; drawing if pen is down |
| `SETY` | — | expr | Jump to a new y, leaving x unchanged; drawing if pen is down |
| `SETHEADING` | `SETH` | expr | Set the turtle's absolute heading (no movement) |
| `HOME` | — | — | `SETXY` back to the start position and `SETHEADING 0`, drawing if pen is down |
| `ARC` | — | `angle radius` | Draw a circle/arc of `radius` centered on the turtle; the turtle doesn't move |
| `TELL` | — | expr (0-9) | Switch which turtle subsequent commands control (see Multiple turtles) |
| `PENUP` | `PU` | — | Stop drawing while moving |
| `PENDOWN` | `PD` | — | Resume drawing while moving |
| `SETPENCOLOR` | `SETPC` | `r g b` (each 0-255) | Set the color new lines are drawn in |
| `SETPENWIDTH` | `SETPW` | expr (clamped 0.5-20) | Set the width new lines are drawn with |
| `SETBACKGROUND` | `SETBG` | `r g b` (each 0-255) | Set the canvas's background color |
| `CLEAR` | `CS` | — | Erase the canvas and reset the turtle's position/angle |
| `CLEAN` | — | — | Erase the canvas only — unlike `CLEAR`/`CS`, the turtle's position/angle are untouched |
| `CLEARTEXT` | `CT` | — | Clear the history pane — separate from `CLEAR`/`CLEAN`'s canvas-only effect |
| `HIDETURTLE` | `HT` | — | Stop drawing the turtle marker (the trail still draws) |
| `SHOWTURTLE` | `ST` | — | Draw the turtle marker again |
| `WRAP` | — | — | Crossing the canvas edge wraps around to the opposite side |
| `FENCE` | — | — | Crossing the canvas edge stops the turtle right at it, with an error |
| `WINDOW` | — | — | No canvas boundary at all (the default) |
| `LABEL` | — | word/list | Draw text at the turtle's position, in its pen color |
| `FILL` | — | — | Flood-fill the region containing the turtle, bounded by drawn lines, with its pen color |
| `ERASERECT` | — | `width height` | Paint a rectangle centered on the turtle in the background color |
| `WAIT` | — | expr (seconds) | Pause before the next command, without freezing the window |
| `SETSPEED` | — | expr (seconds) | Pause this long after every turtle-motion command, for effect or debugging; `0` (the default) means instant, same as before this existed |

`SETXY`/`HOME` draw a connecting line if the pen is down, same as
`FORWARD` — they're a direct jump to a position, not a teleport. `CLEAR`
is the one that resets position without drawing, since it wipes the
canvas first.

```
WRAP
SETXY 600 250      (canvas is 500x500 -- wraps to 100 250, no line drawn)

FENCE
SETXY 600 250      (stops at 500 250, drawing up to the edge, and reports it)
```

- `WRAP`/`FENCE`/`WINDOW` choose what happens when a move (`FD`/`SETXY`/
  etc.) would cross the 500x500 canvas edge — a single canvas-wide
  setting, not per-turtle, and unaffected by `CLEAR` (same as pen color/
  width). `WINDOW` is the default: no boundary at all, exactly as if
  none of these three existed.
- `WRAP` wraps the crossing coordinate around to the opposite edge. The
  pen lifts for that one jump — no line is drawn from one edge to the
  other — so wrapping doesn't paint a stray diagonal line across the
  canvas.
- `FENCE` stops the turtle right at the edge (clamping the position),
  draws the line up to that point, and prints `FENCE: turtle stopped at
  the canvas edge`.

```
SETPENCOLOR 200 0 0
LABEL "hello

REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]
PENUP SETXY 300 200 PENDOWN
SETPENCOLOR 255 200 0
FILL
```

- `LABEL text` draws `text` (a word or list, same as `PRINT`) at the
  turtle's current position, in its current pen color. `CLEAR` erases
  labels along with lines.
- `FILL` flood-fills the region containing the turtle — bounded by
  whatever lines are currently drawn — with its current pen color, the
  same way a paint bucket tool works. `CLEAR` erases fills along with
  lines.
- `FILL`'s boundary is **frozen the instant `FILL` is called**: a line
  drawn afterward, even one that cuts straight through the filled
  region, never retroactively changes what got filled or splits it into
  separately-colored pieces the next time the canvas redraws.
- `ERASERECT width height` paints a `width`-by-`height` rectangle,
  centered on the turtle's current position, in the canvas's background
  color — a punch-out rather than a draw. `CLEAR` erases these along
  with fills and lines. Like `FILL`, it's frozen the instant it's
  called: a line drawn afterward through the erased area draws right
  through it rather than being retroactively erased itself, and doesn't
  bring back whatever the rectangle erased either.

```
REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]
WAIT 2
CLEAR
```

- `WAIT expr` pauses for `expr` seconds (this interpreter's own unit
  choice — real Logo counts 60ths of a second) before running the next
  command, without freezing the window: it queues a redraw of whatever's
  been drawn so far and keeps the GTK event loop responsive while it
  waits, instead of one long blocking sleep. This matters most for a
  script loaded all at once (`LOAD`, or pasting several lines together)
  — typing commands one at a time already shows each one immediately,
  but a whole file runs as a single unit, so without `WAIT`, a `CLEAR`
  partway through would wipe earlier drawing before it was ever visible.

```
SETSPEED 0.1
REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]   (draws one side, pauses 0.1s, four times over)
SETSPEED 0
```

- `SETSPEED expr` sets how long (in seconds, same unit as `WAIT`) the
  turtle pauses after **every** motion command from then on --
  `FORWARD`/`FD`, `BACK`/`BK`, `RIGHT`/`RT`, `LEFT`/`LT`, `SETXY`,
  `SETX`, `SETY`, `SETHEADING`/`SETH`, `HOME`, and `ARC` -- for watching
  a drawing unfold step by step, or slowing things down to debug.
  `SETSPEED 0` (the default) is instant, exactly as if it never existed.
  Uses the same non-freezing real-timer mechanism as `WAIT`, so the
  window stays responsive and redraws between steps.
- `SPEED` (an operator, no argument) reads the current setting back.
- The pause applies uniformly to every turtle-motion command, not just
  `FD` -- a script heavy on `SETXY`/`SETHEADING` slows down exactly the
  same way one built from `FD`/`RT` does.
- Commands that don't move or turn the turtle (`PENUP`, `SETPENCOLOR`,
  `TELL`, `WAIT` itself, ...) are never delayed by `SETSPEED`, whatever
  it's set to.
- Inside a `MAP`/`FILTER`/`REDUCE`/`FOREACH` template, `RUN`, or `LOAD`,
  the delay is silently skipped rather than reported as unsupported the
  way `WAIT` itself would be -- it's an automatic per-step throttle, not
  something the script explicitly asked for at that exact call site.
  Same silent skip inside a concurrent agent (`LAUNCH`/`AWAIT`/`YIELD`,
  see docs/CONCURRENT_AGENTS_DESIGN.md): `SETSPEED` is a single
  canvas-wide setting shared by every agent, but this first pass has no
  real per-agent timer to honor it with yet, so it has no visible
  slowdown effect there.

```
ARC 360 80        (a full circle, radius 80)
RT 45 ARC 90 40    (a quarter arc, offset by the turtle's heading)
```

- `ARC angle radius` draws part (or all, at `angle` 360) of a circle
  centered *at the turtle's current position*, starting from its current
  heading and sweeping clockwise through `angle` degrees. Unlike every
  other drawing command, the turtle itself doesn't move or turn — only
  the arc is drawn, as if a phantom copy of the turtle traced it.
- There's no native arc primitive to draw with, so it's approximated as
  a fan of short straight segments (one per 5 degrees, at least 8 — so a
  360-degree circle is 72 segments). Each segment respects pen color/
  width/up-down exactly like any other drawn line.

All commands are case-insensitive (`fd 100` and `FD 100` are equivalent).

```
SETPENCOLOR 255 0 0
FD 80 RT 90
SETPC 0 100 255
FD 80
```

- `SETPENCOLOR`/`SETPC` takes three expressions, each clamped to 0-255,
  and becomes the color used by every line drawn from then on.
- Each drawn line segment remembers the pen color it was drawn with, so a
  single drawing can freely mix colors across `SETPENCOLOR` calls — it's
  not a single canvas-wide color.
- The turtle's own triangle marker is always the same fixed green/size,
  regardless of pen color or width.
- Default pen color is a dark gray, matching earlier versions of this app
  before `SETPENCOLOR` existed.
- `SETPENWIDTH`/`SETPW` works the same way as `SETPENCOLOR` — each line
  segment remembers the width it was drawn with, so a drawing can mix
  widths across calls. Default is `2`, matching earlier versions of this
  app before `SETPENWIDTH` existed.
- `SETBACKGROUND`/`SETBG` works the same way but sets the canvas's
  background — unlike pen color, this is a single canvas-wide value (not
  remembered per line), so changing it recolors the whole background
  immediately, past drawing included. Default is white.

### Turtle state queries

```
FD 100
PRINT POS               -> 250 150
PRINT HEADING           -> 0

RT 45
MAKE "h HEADING
SETHEADING 200
SETHEADING :h
PRINT HEADING           -> 45
```

- `POS` and `HEADING` are operators (not commands) that read the current
  turtle's position and heading back into an expression — they work
  anywhere an argument is expected, same as `FIRST`/`COUNT`/etc. `SETXY`/
  `SETHEADING`/`RT`/`LT` can *set* these, but until now there was no way
  to *read* them back into a variable.
- `POS` outputs a 2-element list `[x y]`. `HEADING` outputs a plain
  number — the raw stored angle, not normalized to 0-360 (turning `RT 90`
  four times reads back as `360`, not `0`), matching how `RT`/`LT`/
  `SETHEADING` already accumulate it.
- Both always refer to whichever turtle `TELL` currently targets, same as
  `FD`/`RT`/etc.

```
FD 100
PRINT GETX              -> 250
PRINT GETY              -> 150

SETX 10
SETY 20
PRINT POS                -> 10 20
```

- `GETX`/`GETY` are single-axis complements to `POS`, outputting just one
  coordinate as a plain number instead of a 2-element list — handy when
  only one axis is needed and unpacking `POS` with `FIRST`/`LAST` would
  be more than the call site needs.
- `SETX`/`SETY` are single-axis complements to `SETXY`, jumping along
  just one coordinate while leaving the other (and the heading)
  unchanged — drawing a connecting line if the pen is down, same as
  `SETXY` itself.

```
PRINT DISTANCE [0 0] [3 4]      -> 5

SETXY 0 0
SETHEADING TOWARDS [120 90]
FORWARD DISTANCE POS [120 90]
PRINT POS                        -> 120 90
```

- `DISTANCE p1 p2` outputs the straight-line distance between two
  arbitrary `[x y]` points — it isn't tied to the turtle's own position
  (pass `POS` as one of the two points for "distance from here").
  `TOWARDS point` outputs the heading (same 0-360 convention as
  `HEADING`) to face directly from the turtle's *current* position
  toward `point`. Together they answer "turn to face a target, then
  walk exactly far enough to arrive there" in two lines, as shown above.
- Both report an error if either argument isn't a 2-element list:
  `DISTANCE: expected two 2-element lists` / `TOWARDS: expected a
  2-element list`.

## Expressions

Anywhere a command expects a number (`FD`, `RT`, a `REPEAT` count, a
procedure argument, `MAKE`'s value, ...), a full numeric expression is
accepted:

- Literals: `100`, `3.5`, `-2`
- Operators: `+ - * /`, standard precedence, unary `+`/`-`
- Parentheses: `(1 + 2) * 3`
- Variables: `:name` (see below)
- Prefix arithmetic operators, all one argument except `MOD`/`POWER`
  (two), binding like the list operators do (tighter than `* / + -`, so
  `MOD 7 3 + 1` is `(MOD 7 3) + 1`):
  - `MOD a b` — remainder, with the sign of `b` (so `MOD -7 3` is `2`,
    not `-1` the way C's own `%`/`fmod` would give).
  - `POWER a b` — `a` raised to the power `b`.
  - `SQRT a`, `ABS a`, `ROUND a` — square root, absolute value, and
    round-to-nearest-integer.
  - `INT a` — truncates towards zero (`INT 2.9` is `2`, `INT -2.9` is
    `-2`), unlike `ROUND` (`ROUND -2.9` is `-3`).
  - `SIN a`, `COS a`, `ARCTAN a`, `TAN a`, `ASIN a`, `ACOS a` — trig
    functions; `a`/the result are in **degrees**, matching `RT`/`LT`/
    `HEADING`'s convention, not radians.
  - `LOG a` — base-10 logarithm. `LN a` — natural logarithm. `EXP a` —
    `e` raised to a power, `LN`'s inverse (so `LN EXP a` is `a`).
  - `RANDOM n` — a random integer in `[0, n)`.

Division by zero evaluates to `0` rather than crashing or erroring.
`SQRT` of a negative number, `ASIN`/`ACOS` outside `[-1, 1]`, and
`LOG`/`LN` of a non-positive number all return C's own `NaN` rather
than a special error — they print as `nan`, which is visibly broken
rather than a plausible-looking wrong number, so nothing special was
added on top.

## Variables & scoping

```
MAKE "size 100
FD :size
MAKE "size :size + 10
```

- `MAKE "name expr` sets a variable to a number, creating it if it doesn't
  already exist.
- `:name` reads a variable's value inside any expression.
- Variables are either numbers or **words** — see "Words & lists" below.
- `THING name` also reads a variable back, but takes `name` as any
  expression evaluating to a word rather than a literal identifier —
  `:name` only ever takes a name written right there in the source,
  while `THING WORD "item :n` can compute which variable to read at run
  time. Otherwise identical to `:name`: same scope search, same `0` for
  an unbound name.

Procedure parameters are **local, dynamically-scoped** variables. Calling a
procedure pushes a fresh scope binding its parameters to the (already
evaluated) argument values; that scope is popped when the call returns.
`:name` and `MAKE "name` search the active call's scope first, then any
outer calls on the stack, then the globals — so:

- A parameter shadows a same-named global or outer-call variable for the
  duration of that call.
- `MAKE "n ...` inside a procedure with a parameter `:n` reassigns that
  parameter (it's a real variable now, not a text substitution) — it does
  not create an unrelated global.
- Recursive calls each get their own independent scope, so `:n` in one
  call of a recursive procedure never sees another call's `:n`.
- This is *dynamic* scoping, matching classic Logo: a procedure with no
  parameter of its own named `x` can still see and, via `MAKE`, mutate an
  outer call's local `x` if one is active. Only when no matching binding
  exists anywhere on the call stack does `MAKE` fall back to creating a
  global.
- Recursion is capped at ~2000 nested calls (`MAX_VM_SCOPE_DEPTH`,
  `src/vm.h` — raised from an original 200 once the VM got its own
  scope storage, see `docs/BYTECODE_VM_DESIGN.md`); going deeper prints
  "Recursion too deep, call ignored" instead of crashing.

```
TO uselocal
  LOCAL "x
  MAKE "x 1
  PRINT :x
END
```

- `LOCAL "name` declares a variable scoped to the current call, the same
  way a parameter is, but without being one — useful for a working
  variable a procedure needs internally that has nothing to do with its
  arguments. It reads as `0` until assigned, and is popped along with
  the rest of the call's scope when the procedure returns.
- Only valid inside an active procedure call — `LOCAL` at the top level
  (not inside any `TO`) prints `LOCAL: can only be used inside a
  procedure`.
- A call's locals share the same fixed-size slot table (`MAX_PARAMS` —
  8) that its parameters use, so a procedure with many parameters may
  not have room left for additional `LOCAL`s; going over prints `LOCAL:
  too many local variables`.

### Property lists

```
SETPROP "turtle1 "color "red
SETPROP "turtle1 "speed 5
PRINT GETPROP "turtle1 "color   ; red
PRINT GETPROP "turtle1 "nosuchkey   ; the empty list -- nothing stored there
PRINT PROPLIST "turtle1   ; color red speed 5
REMOVEPROP "turtle1 "color
```

A separate namespace from ordinary `MAKE`/`:name` variables — a way to
attach an open-ended set of named values ("properties") to a name,
without pre-declaring which properties exist. (Other Logo dialects call
these `PPROP`/`GPROP`/`REMPROP`/`PLIST` — renamed here since there's no
real cross-dialect standard to match and the abbreviations aren't
self-explanatory.)

- `SETPROP plistname propname value` stores `value` (any type — number,
  word, list, or array) under `propname` in the property list named
  `plistname`, creating the entry if it doesn't exist yet or overwriting
  it in place if it does.
- `GETPROP plistname propname` retrieves that value, or the empty list
  if nothing has been stored under that key — never an error, so it's
  safe to call speculatively (`IF NOT EMPTY? GETPROP "turtle1 "color
  [...]`).
- `REMOVEPROP plistname propname` deletes the entry; a silent no-op if
  it wasn't there.
- `PROPLIST plistname` outputs the whole record as a flat list,
  alternating property names and values (`[color red speed 5]`) —
  nothing at all (the empty list) for a `plistname` with no properties
  stored.
- `plistname` and `propname` are each any expression evaluating to a
  word, same convention as `THING` — `SETPROP WORD "turtle :n "color
  "red` works, not just a literal `"turtle1`.
- Every property list shares one global table regardless of scope —
  there's no `LOCAL`-style scoping for properties the way there is for
  variables.

## Prototype-style objects

```
TO animal_speak :self
  PRINT SENTENCE :self GETPROP :self "sound
END

NEW "animal "nothing
SETPROP "animal "speak "animal_speak
SETPROP "animal "sound "generic

NEW "dog "animal
SETPROP "dog "sound "Woof

SEND "dog "speak []      -> dog Woof
SEND "animal "speak []   -> animal generic
```

No classes, no new value type — an "object" is just a property list
(see "Property lists" above) with a `"prototype` property pointing at
its parent, the same prototype-based style Self/JavaScript use rather
than Berkeley Logo's own (class-based) Object Logo dialect.

- `NEW objname prototypename` sets `objname`'s `"prototype` property to
  `prototypename` — shorthand for writing that `SETPROP` by hand, only
  more readable at the call site. `prototypename` can name anything,
  including an object that doesn't otherwise exist yet, or a
  placeholder like `"nothing` for the root of a hierarchy.
- A **method** is an ordinary procedure taking `:self` as its first
  input, registered under a message name with plain `SETPROP` — e.g.
  `SETPROP "animal "speak "animal_speak` registers `animal_speak` (any
  procedure name, no naming convention enforced beyond the leading
  `:self`) to answer `speak`.
- `SEND obj "message arg1 arg2...` looks `message` up on `obj`'s own
  property list first; if it's not there, follows `obj`'s own
  `"prototype` property and checks there instead, repeating up the
  chain until something answers or the chain runs out. `self` is never
  one of `SEND`'s own arguments — it's always `obj`, automatically
  prepended to whatever args followed the message name, so a method
  declared `TO animal_greet :self :name` is sent as `SEND "dog "greet
  "alice`, not `SEND "dog "greet "dog "alice`.
- Like an ordinary procedure call, `SEND` comes in both the command
  form above (a method run for its side effects, discarding any
  `OUTPUT`) and an operator form usable inside an expression (`PRINT
  SEND "dog "getname`, `MAKE "n SEND "dog "getname`) — same
  `didn't output a value` error if the resolved method never
  `OUTPUT`s, for the same reason a plain procedure used as an operator
  needs one.
- **Methods inherit through the chain; data fields don't.** `SEND`
  walks `"prototype` links looking for a message; plain `GETPROP` never
  does, even on an object built with `NEW`. A shared *default* value
  has to be a method that outputs a constant (like `animal_speak`
  above falling back to `"generic`), not a plain property, if it's
  meant to be inherited — an object with no property of its own for a
  given key just gets the empty list back from `GETPROP`, prototype or
  not.
- Errors: `SEND: obj does not understand message` if nothing in the
  whole chain (up to `obj` itself) has that property at all;
  `SEND: message is not a method on obj` if it's there but its value
  isn't a word naming a real procedure (e.g. it's a plain data field,
  or the procedure it once named was redefined away); `SEND: name must
  take :self as its first input` if the resolved procedure has zero
  parameters.
- A cyclic prototype chain (an object that's its own ancestor, directly
  or through a longer cycle) doesn't hang — the chain walk is capped
  the same bounded-loop way `WHILE`'s own runaway-loop cap works, so it
  just runs out of chain and reports `does not understand` instead of
  looping forever.
- Property lists share one flat, global table of `MAX_PLIST_ENTRIES`
  (200) records total across *every* plist in the whole program (see
  "Property lists" above) — objects don't get their own budget, so a
  program creating many objects with several properties each can run
  into `too many properties defined` sooner than it might expect.

## Words & lists

```
MAKE "name "World
PRINT :name
IF :name = "World [PRINT "matched]

MAKE "greeting [Hello there, friend!]
PRINT :greeting
IF :greeting = [Hello there, friend!] [PRINT "matched]
```

- `MAKE "name "word` sets a variable to a **word** — a single token, no
  spaces — instead of a number. `:name` still reads it back the same way.
- `'raw text'` is also a word, but everything between the quotes exactly
  as typed, spaces included — the one way to write a literal space (or
  any other whitespace) directly in Logo source, since `"word`'s own
  reading always stops at the first one. `PRINT 'hello world'` prints
  `hello world`; `COUNT 'hello world'` is `11` (characters), not `2`
  (words) — it's still one word, not a list, so `PARSE 'hello world'`
  is how to split it into `[hello world]` if you want that instead.
  Missing the closing `'` prints `'...': missing closing ' or too long`
  (and, same as an unterminated `[...]`, consumes the rest of the input
  looking for it rather than stopping at the end of the line).
- `MAKE "name [some words]` sets a variable to a **list**: the elements
  inside the brackets, in order, with whitespace between them normalized
  (so `[hello   world]` and `[hello world]` produce the same value). This
  is the same bracketed syntax `PRINT [...]` uses (see Output below) —
  it's a value here instead of being printed immediately.
- Lists nest: an element can itself be a bracketed sublist, e.g. `[a [b
  c] d]` is a 3-element list whose second element is the 2-element list
  `[b c]`. See "List operators" and "List construction" below for reading
  and building nested structure.
- A word and a list are two distinct kinds of value — `"word` (a single
  token, no spaces) versus `[a list]` (elements, possibly nested). `MAKE
  "a :b` copies whichever kind `:b` currently holds, unchanged.
- A word used inside a numeric context (arithmetic, a `FORWARD`/`REPEAT`/
  etc. argument) coerces by reading the number its text starts with —
  `FD FIRST [100 50]` moves forward `100` — falling back to `0` if it
  doesn't start with one at all (`PRINT "hello + 1` is `1`); a list
  coerces to `0`, having no meaningful numeric reading. This applies
  everywhere: every argument in the language (`PRINT`, `MAKE`, turtle
  commands, `REPEAT`'s count, procedure-call arguments, comparisons, ...)
  is parsed by the same word/list-aware expression evaluator.
- `MAKE "a :b` copies `:b`'s value as-is — word, number, or list (a bare
  `:name` only — `MAKE "a :b + 1` still evaluates numerically, same as any
  other compound expression). Copying a list this way is just copying a
  reference to its (immutable) elements, not a deep copy — cheap
  regardless of the list's size.

### List operators (and substrings)

```
MAKE "colors [red green blue]
PRINT FIRST :colors            -> red
PRINT LAST :colors             -> blue
PRINT BUTFIRST :colors         -> green blue
PRINT BUTLAST :colors          -> red green
PRINT COUNT :colors            -> 3
PRINT ITEM 2 :colors           -> green
IF FIRST :colors = "red [PRINT "yes]

PRINT COUNT [a [b c] d]        -> 3 (top-level elements only — [b c] counts as one)
PRINT FIRST [[1 2] 3]          -> 1 2 (the sublist [1 2], printed — see Output below
                                        for why a list PRINT'ing as its own top-level
                                        value never shows its own brackets)

PRINT FIRST "hello              -> h
PRINT LAST "hello               -> o
PRINT BUTFIRST "hello           -> ello
PRINT BUTLAST "hello            -> hell
PRINT COUNT "hello              -> 5
PRINT ITEM 3 "hello              -> l
```

- `FIRST`, `BUTFIRST`, `LAST`, and `BUTLAST` take one word/list-ish
  argument. On a list, they operate on its top-level elements only — an
  element that's itself a sublist is returned/skipped whole, not
  flattened into it. `FIRST`/`LAST` return that element as-is (a word, a
  number, or a list); `BUTFIRST` returns everything after the first
  element, `BUTLAST` everything except the last. `COUNT` takes the same
  kind of argument and returns a **number** — how many top-level elements
  it has (a sublist element counts as one, regardless of its own length).
- `ITEM index thing` is random access by position (1-indexed): the
  `index`th top-level element of a list, or the `index`th character of a
  word. An `index` less than 1 or past the end is a reported error (see
  Errors below) rather than a silent empty result or a crash.
- On a **word**, `FIRST`/`BUTFIRST`/`LAST`/`BUTLAST`/`COUNT`/`ITEM` all
  work the same way but one level deeper: a word is a sequence of
  *characters*, not one atomic element, so `FIRST`/`LAST`/`ITEM` return a
  single-character word, `BUTFIRST`/`BUTLAST` return the rest as a word,
  and `COUNT` returns its length. This is substrings — the only way to
  pull characters out of a word, no separate substring syntax needed. A
  bare **number**, unlike a word, stays atomic and does not decompose
  into digits (`COUNT 12345` is `1`, not `5`) — consistent with treating
  it as a one-element list, same as before nested lists existed.
- The argument to any of these can be a `"word`, a `[bracketed list]`, a
  `:variable` holding either, a nested list operator call (`FIRST BUTFIRST
  :colors`), or a bare number (treated as a one-element list, so `COUNT 5`
  is `1`, and only `ITEM 1` of one is valid). `FIRST`/`LAST`/`BUTFIRST`/
  `BUTLAST` of an empty list (`[]`) or an empty word (`""`) is empty;
  `COUNT` of either is `0`.
- All six work anywhere an argument is expected — `PRINT`, `MAKE "name`,
  both sides of `=`/`<>`, and plain arithmetic (`FD FIRST :colors`,
  `REPEAT COUNT :items [...]`) — coercing to a number the same way any
  other word does when arithmetic touches it (see above).

```
PRINT PICK [10 20 30]     -> 10, 20, or 30
PRINT PICK "hello         -> a random single character of "hello
```

- `PICK thing` outputs a random element — a random top-level element of
  a list, a random character of a word, or a random slot of an array
  (see "Arrays" below) — trivial given `RANDOM`/`ITEM`/`COUNT` already
  exist. Reports `PICK: empty list` / `PICK: empty word` for an empty
  list/word (an array's size is always at least 1, so it can't be
  empty).

### List construction

```
PRINT WORD "hello "world        -> helloworld
PRINT SENTENCE "a "b            -> a b
PRINT SE [1 2] [3 4]            -> 1 2 3 4
PRINT LIST [1 2] [3 4]          -> [1 2] [3 4]
MAKE "colors [green blue]
PRINT FPUT "red :colors         -> red green blue
PRINT LPUT "purple :colors      -> green blue purple
PRINT FPUT [1 2] [3 4]          -> [1 2] 3 4
PRINT FPUT "a "bc                -> abc
```

- `WORD a b` concatenates two words directly with **no** space between
  them — pure string concatenation. It only accepts word/number
  arguments; passing it a list is an error (see Errors below) rather than
  silently flattening the list's structure into text.
- `SENTENCE a b` (or `SE`) **splices** two values into one flat list: a
  list argument contributes its own elements individually, a word/number
  argument contributes itself as one element.
- `LIST a b` **wraps** instead: each argument becomes exactly one element
  regardless of whether it's itself a list, so `LIST [1 2] [3 4]` is the
  2-element list `[[1 2] [3 4]]` (each element a sublist) — never
  splicing the way `SENTENCE` does. This is the actual difference between
  the two operators, now that lists nest; with only word/number
  arguments, they still behave identically (`LIST "x "y` is `x y`, same
  as `SENTENCE "x "y`).
- `FPUT thing list` prepends `thing` as a new first element; `LPUT thing
  list` appends it as a new last element. If `thing` is itself a list,
  this creates genuine nesting (`FPUT [1 2] [3 4]` is `[[1 2] 3 4]`,
  printing as `[1 2] 3 4`) rather than splicing it in.
- If `list` is itself a **word**, `FPUT`/`LPUT` build a new word by
  prepending/appending `thing`'s text as characters instead (`FPUT "a
  "bc` is `"abc"`, not a list) — consistent with a word being a sequence
  of characters (see "List operators (and substrings)" above). `thing`
  being a list has no character-level meaning to merge in, so that's a
  reported error instead (see Errors below) rather than silently
  flattening it into text.
- All four take exactly two arguments (nest calls for more: `WORD "a
  WORD "b "c`) and, like the list operators above, work anywhere an
  argument is expected — including plain arithmetic.

### FLATTEN, PARSE, SUBST

```
PRINT FLATTEN [1 [2 3] [4 [5 6]] 7]   -> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
PRINT FLATTEN [a b c]                 -> a b c (already flat -- unchanged)

PRINT PARSE "hello                    -> hello (a one-element list)
PRINT PARSE [red green blue]          -> red green blue

PRINT SUBST "b "x [a b c b]           -> a x c x
PRINT SUBST "b "x [a [b c] [d [b e]]] -> a [x c] [d [x e]]
PRINT SUBST [1 2] "x [[1 2] 3 4]      -> x 3 4
```

- `FLATTEN thing` collapses every level of nesting into one flat list:
  a sublist's own brackets disappear, and its leaf elements take their
  place at the top level, in order — only meaningful now that lists
  really nest. A bare word/number is treated as a one-element list, same
  as `COUNT`/`FIRST`/etc.
- `PARSE thing` tokenizes `thing`'s printed text (the same rendering
  `PRINT` shows) by whitespace into a list of words — the reverse of
  what `PRINT` already does for a plain word. It's a pure text split,
  not bracket-aware: parsing a list that itself contains a sublist
  yields literal `"[..."`/`"...]"`-shaped word tokens back, not a real
  nested list, since a bracket is just another non-space character here.
- `SUBST old new thing` rebuilds `thing`, replacing every element equal
  to `old` with `new` — including a whole matching sublist as one unit,
  not just a leaf value (`SUBST [1 2] "x [[1 2] 3 4]` replaces the whole
  `[1 2]` sublist). A non-matching sublist is recursed into, so a nested
  occurrence substitutes without disturbing the rest of that sublist. A
  bare (non-list) `thing` just checks itself directly against `old`.

### Arrays

```
MAKE "a ARRAY 3
SETITEM 1 :a "red
SETITEM 2 :a "green
SETITEM 3 :a "blue
PRINT :a               -> {red green blue}
PRINT ITEM 2 :a        -> green
PRINT COUNT :a         -> 3
```

- `ARRAY size` creates a new array of `size` slots (`size` must be at
  least 1), each defaulting to an empty list, matching real Logo.
  Unlike a list, an array is stored as directly-indexed slots rather
  than a linked chain — reaching slot `n` is one step, not a walk past
  the first `n - 1` elements, which is the whole reason to reach for an
  array over a list.
- `ITEM index array` reads a slot (1-indexed, same convention as
  `ITEM` on a list/word) and `SETITEM index array value` overwrites one
  in place. `SETITEM`'s `value` can be a number, word, or list — but not
  another array (see below) — and prints `SETITEM: index out of range`
  for an out-of-bounds `index`, or `SETITEM: expected an array` if given
  something other than an array.
- `FILLARRAY array value` overwrites every slot with the same `value` in
  one call, rather than looping `SETITEM` manually. Same `value`/error
  rules as `SETITEM` (`FILLARRAY: expected an array` /
  `FILLARRAY: can't store an array inside an array`), just applied to
  every index at once.
- `ARRAY?` reports (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) whether a value is an array, and
  `COUNT` reports its length — same conventions as the other type
  predicates and `COUNT` on a list/word.
- **Arrays are the one mutable, reference-like value in this
  language.** Every other value here is copy-on-build — `MAKE "b :a`
  for a list just aliases the same (never-mutated) underlying nodes, so
  the aliasing is invisible. An array is different: `MAKE "b :a` shares
  the *same* underlying slots, so `SETITEM` through either `:a` or `:b`
  is visible from both — assigning an array doesn't copy it.
- An array always prints inside `{ }`, even as `PRINT`'s own top-level
  value — unlike a list, whose own outermost brackets are never shown
  that way (see "Output" below). This matches real Logo's own
  convention of printing arrays and lists distinctly.
- Arrays are more limited than lists: `FIRST`/`BUTFIRST`/`LAST`/
  `BUTLAST`/`MEMBER?`/`WORD`/`SENTENCE`/`LIST`/`FPUT`/`LPUT`/`MAP`/
  `FILTER`/`REDUCE`/`FOREACH` don't support them — only `ARRAY`/`ITEM`/
  `SETITEM`/`ARRAY?`/`COUNT` do. An array also can't be nested inside
  another array's slot (`SETITEM` prints `SETITEM: can't store an array
  inside an array`). Passing one as a user-defined procedure's argument
  works, and — same as `MAKE "b :a` — keeps its aliasing: `SETITEM`
  through the parameter is visible to the caller's own variable too,
  since both now share the same underlying storage.

### DOT, CROSS

```
PRINT DOT [1 2 3] [4 5 6]     -> 32   (1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6)
PRINT CROSS [1 0 0] [0 1 0]   -> 0 0 1
```

- `DOT a b` computes the dot product of two numeric lists of the same
  length — the sum of each pair of elements multiplied together.
  Prints `DOT: expected two lists` if either argument isn't a list, or
  `DOT: lists must be the same length` if their lengths differ.
- `CROSS a b` computes the 3D cross product of two numeric lists,
  returning a new 3-element list. Only defined for 3-element vectors,
  so it prints `CROSS: expected two 3-element lists` for anything else
  (including a length that isn't exactly 3).
- Both coerce each element the same way any other numeric context does
  (see "Words & lists" above) — a word element reads as the number its
  text starts with, falling back to `0`.

### TRUE, FALSE

```
PRINT TRUE
PRINT FALSE
MAKE "flag TRUE
IF :flag [PRINT "yes]
```

- `TRUE` and `FALSE` are real values — printable, storable in a
  variable with `MAKE`, and passable around like any other word. They're
  words rather than a distinct value type (real Logo doesn't have one
  either): `TRUE`/`FALSE` are just special-cased, case-insensitive
  keyword literals, same spelling either way (`PRINT true` also prints
  `TRUE`).
- `IF`/`WHILE` (and the comparisons/`AND`/`OR`/`NOT` inside their
  condition) treat the word `FALSE` as false, and everything else
  (including `TRUE`, any other non-empty word, or a nonzero number) as
  true — the same non-empty-word-is-true convention as before, with one
  added special case for the literal word `FALSE`.
- Comparisons (`=`, `<`, etc.) and `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` themselves are
  unchanged — they only exist inside `IF`/`WHILE`'s own condition slot
  (see Conditionals below), not as general expression values. There's no
  `PRINT :a = :b` or `MAKE "bigger :a > :b` — only `IF :a = :b [...]`.

### Type & membership predicates

```
PRINT WORD? "hi           -> TRUE
PRINT LIST? [1 2]         -> TRUE
PRINT NUMBER? 5           -> TRUE
PRINT EMPTY? []           -> TRUE
PRINT EMPTY? [1]          -> FALSE
PRINT MEMBER? "b [a b c]  -> TRUE
PRINT MEMBER? "ell "hello -> TRUE

IF WORD? "hi [PRINT "yes]
```

- `WORD?`, `LIST?`, and `NUMBER?` each take one argument and report
  (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) whether it's that kind of value — the only way to ask
  "what kind of value is this?" from inside a running program.
- `EMPTY?` reports whether a list (`[]`) or word (`""`) is empty; a
  number is never "empty" (always `FALSE`).
- `MEMBER? thing container` reports whether `thing` is one of
  `container`'s top-level elements (a list), or a substring of it (a
  word — so `MEMBER? "ell "hello` is true, not just single-character
  checks); a bare number `container` is treated as a one-element list,
  same convention as `FIRST`/`COUNT`/etc.
- All five return `TRUE`/`FALSE` (see "TRUE, FALSE" above) rather than a
  special boolean type, so they work directly in `IF`/`WHILE` or
  combined with `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`.

## Procedures

```
TO rect :w :h
  REPEAT 2 [FD :w RT 90 FD :h RT 90]
END

rect 100 40
```

- Defined with `TO name [:param ...] ... END`. `END` ends the definition —
  don't use the literal word `END` elsewhere in a procedure body.
- Up to 8 parameters are supported per procedure, bound positionally: the
  first argument at the call site fills the first declared parameter, and
  so on. Arguments are evaluated in the *caller's* scope, before the
  callee's own scope is pushed. A parameter keeps whatever type its
  argument actually is — a number, word, list, or array — not just a
  number: `TO test :x PRINT :x END` then `test [1 2 3]` prints `1 2 3`,
  not `0`.
- Defining a `TO` with a name that already exists **overwrites** the
  existing procedure in place — handy for fixing a typo and re-running the
  definition. `ERASE "name` removes a procedure entirely.
- `SHOW "name` prints a procedure's own definition back out, exactly as
  `SAVE` would write it to a file — `TO name :params`, its body, then
  `END`. Prints `SHOW: no such procedure "name` if it isn't defined.
- `TEXT "name` is the read-as-data complement to `SHOW`: instead of
  printing the definition, it outputs the procedure's raw body text
  tokenized into a flat list of words — the same whitespace tokenizing
  `PARSE` does (see "FLATTEN, PARSE, SUBST" above), not a full re-parse
  of Logo syntax. A `"quoted word or a `[bracketed block]` in the body
  keeps its punctuation as literal characters within a token, rather
  than being reinterpreted the way `eval_logo` itself would — so `TEXT`
  of a body containing `PRINT "hi` gives a two-word list whose second
  word is the literal text `"hi`, quote character included, not the
  word `hi`. Prints `TEXT: no such procedure "name` if it isn't defined.
- Procedures can call other procedures, including recursively.
- `PROCEDURES` outputs a list of every currently-defined procedure's
  name, in definition order — workspace introspection alongside `SHOW`.
- `NAMES` outputs a list of every currently-defined **global**
  variable's name — a procedure's own parameters and any `LOCAL`s don't
  appear, only whatever `MAKE` has set outside of (or before) any call.
  Reassigning an existing name with `MAKE` doesn't add a second entry.

### OUTPUT, STOP

```
TO double :n
  OUTPUT :n * 2
END
PRINT double 5        -> 10

TO fact :n
  IF :n = 0 [OUTPUT 1]
  OUTPUT :n * fact :n - 1
END
PRINT fact 5           -> 120
```

- `OUTPUT expr` (or `OP expr`) ends the current procedure call and hands
  `expr` back as its value — like a `return` statement. That's what lets
  a procedure call be used as a value anywhere an argument is expected
  (`PRINT double 5`, `MAKE "x double 5`), the same way `FIRST`/`WORD`/
  etc. already can. A same-named built-in always wins over a
  user-defined procedure at this "used as a value" position, same
  precedence rule the ordinary command dispatch already has for command
  names.
- `STOP` ends the current call the same way but with no value at all —
  for a procedure that's only ever called for its side effects (like a
  turtle-drawing procedure), used to bail out early (e.g. `IF :n < 0
  [STOP]`).
- Calling a procedure that never actually reaches an `OUTPUT` (it either
  runs to completion or hits a bare `STOP` first) as if it *were* a
  value is a reported error — `<name>: didn't output a value` — rather
  than a silent `0` or empty word.
- Called as a plain statement instead (not inside another expression),
  a procedure's `OUTPUT` value is simply discarded, no error either way
  — `double 5` alone on a line just runs it.
- `OUTPUT`/`STOP` can appear anywhere inside the procedure, including
  nested inside any number of `REPEAT`/`IF`/`WHILE`/`FOR`/`FOREVER`
  blocks, and still end the *whole call* — not just the block they're
  textually inside.
- `OUTPUT` needs an active procedure call to hand its value back to, so
  it's an error at the top level: `OUTPUT: can only be used inside a
  procedure`. `STOP` has no such requirement — it's also the only way to
  escape a `FOREVER` typed directly at the top level (there's no
  condition to fall false there), so a bare top-level `STOP` is legal:
  it just quietly ends the rest of that run, the same way it ends the
  rest of a procedure call, with nothing printed either way.

### CATCH, THROW

```
CATCH "err [
  PRINT "before
  THROW "err
  PRINT "unreachable
]
PRINT "after            -> before
                            after

TO inner
  THROW "boom
END
TO outer
  inner
  PRINT "unreachable
END
CATCH "boom [outer]
PRINT "after-boom        -> after-boom (nothing from inner/outer prints)
```

- `CATCH "tag [block]` runs `block`; if a `THROW "tag` (same tag, matched
  case-insensitively like everything else) happens anywhere inside it —
  including inside procedures it calls, however deeply nested — execution
  jumps straight back to right after `CATCH`, skipping the rest of
  `block` and every call frame in between. If `block` never throws,
  `CATCH` just runs it normally and produces no other effect.
- `THROW "tag` unwinds up through as many call frames (procedure calls,
  `REPEAT`/`IF`/`WHILE` blocks) as it takes to reach the nearest enclosing
  `CATCH` whose tag matches — skipping any `CATCH`es with a different tag
  along the way, the way an exception skips a `catch` block for the wrong
  type in other languages.
- A `THROW` with no matching `CATCH` anywhere prints `THROW: no CATCH
  found for "tag` and execution then resumes with whatever top-level
  command comes next — the same recovery an unrecognized command already
  gets, not a crash or a silently bricked interpreter. Inside a
  `LAUNCH`ed agent the same message is printed and that agent stops;
  the other agents and the main script carry on. Under
  `bin/logomotive --headless`, a run in which this happened exits 1.
- `CATCH`/`THROW` are independent of `OUTPUT`/`STOP`: a `STOP` or
  `OUTPUT` inside a `CATCH`'s block still only unwinds to its own
  enclosing procedure call, same as if the `CATCH` weren't there; `CATCH`
  doesn't intercept those.
- `CATCH` prints `CATCH: expected [ block ]` if the bracketed block is
  missing, unterminated, or too long, same as `REPEAT`/`IF`/`WHILE`.

### Deferred execution: RUN, APPLY

```
RUN [FD 100 RT 90]

MAKE "prog [FD 50 RT 90]
RUN :prog

TO add2 :a :b
  PRINT :a + :b
END
APPLY "add2 [3 4]        -> 7
```

- `RUN thing` executes a stored word or list as Logo source, exactly as
  if it had been typed directly — the thing that makes a list double as
  a deferred program instead of just data. A list containing a nested
  `[...]` block (like `RUN [REPEAT 4 [FD 10 RT 90]]`) round-trips
  correctly: a sublist always renders back out with its own brackets
  (see "Output" below), which happens to mean it's valid Logo source
  again.
- `APPLY "name arglist` calls procedure `name` with its arguments taken
  from `arglist`, instead of parsed positionally from the command line.
  The list's element count must exactly match the procedure's parameter
  count — `APPLY: wrong number of inputs for procedure "name` otherwise.
- Both are commands, not operators usable inside an expression the way
  `FIRST`/`WORD`/etc. are — there's no `PRINT RUN [...]` or
  `MAKE "x APPLY "name [...]` that captures a value back out of them.
- A self-referential `RUN` (e.g. `MAKE "x [RUN :x]` then `RUN :x`) is
  capped and reported as `RUN: too deeply nested, ignored` rather than
  crashing — this is a much lower, separate limit from ordinary
  recursion, since nested `RUN`s are considerably more expensive per
  level and a self-referential one is always a mistake in the program,
  never a legitimate technique.

### Higher-order iteration: MAP, FOREACH, FILTER, REDUCE

```
PRINT MAP [? * 2] [1 2 3]         -> 2 4 6
PRINT FILTER [? > 2] [1 2 3 4]    -> 3 4
PRINT REDUCE [?1 + ?2] [1 2 3 4]  -> 10
FOREACH [PRINT ?] [1 2 3]
```

- All four take a **template** — a `[bracketed expression]` with `?`
  standing in for the current element (`?1`/`?2` for `REDUCE`'s
  accumulator-so-far and current-element, since it needs two slots) —
  and a list (a bare word/number is treated as a one-element list, same
  convention as `FIRST`/`COUNT`/etc.). There's no procedure-name template
  form (`MAP "double :list`) — only the bracketed-expression form above.
- `MAP` builds a new list by substituting `?` and evaluating the
  template as an **expression** once per element. `FILTER` substitutes
  and evaluates the template as a **condition** (so comparisons like
  `? > 2` work, not just arithmetic) once per element, keeping the
  *original* element — not the template's true/false result — whenever
  it's true. `REDUCE` folds left to right, seeding the accumulator with
  the list's own first element (no separate start-value argument).
  `FOREACH` is the odd one out: it's a command, not an operator — it
  *runs* the substituted template once per element for side effects
  (like `PRINT`), producing no list of its own.
- If an element is itself a list, it's substituted in *with* its
  brackets (`MAP [COUNT ?] [[1 2] [3 4 5]]` is `2 3`) — otherwise its own
  elements would spill out as separate tokens into the template instead
  of staying one value. A non-numeric word element is substituted in
  quoted the same way (`FOREACH [PRINT ?] [the cat sat]` prints `the`/
  `cat`/`sat`, not the word's own characters or an attempted command);
  a numeric-looking one is left bare so it still compares/computes as
  the number it is, not text that merely looks like one.

## Conditionals

```
IF :size > 10 [PRINT "big]
IF :size > 10 [PRINT "big] ELSE [PRINT "small]
IFELSE :size > 10 [PRINT "big] [PRINT "small]
```

- `IF <condition> [block]` runs `block` only if `condition` is true.
- `IF <condition> [block] ELSE [block]` and `IFELSE <condition> [block]
  [block]` are equivalent — both run the first block when true, the second
  when false. (`IF` accepts the second block with or without the literal
  `ELSE` keyword in between.)
- Conditions are expressions optionally followed by a relational operator
  and a second expression: `< > = <= >= <>`. If no relational operator is
  present, the expression's truthiness is used (non-zero number, or
  non-empty word = true).
- `=` and `<>` also work between words (`:name = "Alice`, or
  `:greeting = [hello there]`), comparing text case-insensitively.
  `< > <= >=` are numeric-only — comparing a word with one of those
  always reports false.

```
IF :x > 0 AND :x < 10 [PRINT "in-range]
IF :x < 0 OR :x > 100 [PRINT "out-of-range]
IF NOT :x = 0 [PRINT "nonzero]
```

- `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` combine comparisons into a larger condition, same
  as in `IF`/`IFELSE`/`WHILE`. `NOT` binds tightest, then `AND`, then `OR`
  — standard boolean precedence — and clauses combine strictly left to
  right within each level.
- There are **no parentheses for grouping** boolean clauses (parens are
  only for arithmetic — see Expressions above). `:a AND :b OR :c` always
  parses as `(:a AND :b) OR :c`; if that's not what you mean, restructure
  the condition (e.g. two separate `IF`s) rather than trying to force
  grouping with parens.

## Loops

```
REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]
```

- `REPEAT <expr> [block]` evaluates `block` `expr` times (truncated to an
  integer). Blocks can nest and contain any commands, including further
  `REPEAT`/`IF`/`WHILE`/procedure calls.

```
MAKE "i 0
WHILE :i < 4 [FD 80 RT 90 MAKE "i :i + 1]
```

- `WHILE <condition> [block]` re-checks `condition` before each pass and
  runs `block` for as long as it's true. Unlike `REPEAT`, the condition is
  a live expression — remember to update whatever it depends on inside the
  block, or the loop won't terminate.
- As a safety net against runaway loops freezing the app, `WHILE` stops
  itself after 1,000,000 iterations and prints a warning to the history
  pane rather than hanging.

```
FOR [i 1 5] [PRINT :i]
FOR [i 5 1] [PRINT :i]
FOR [i 0 10 5] [PRINT :i]
```

- `FOR [var start limit step] [block]` is a counted loop that exposes the
  loop variable directly as `:var`, unlike `REPEAT` (count only, no
  variable) or `WHILE` (a condition you update by hand). `step` is
  optional: it defaults to `1`, or `-1` when `limit` is less than `start`,
  same as Berkeley Logo. `start`/`limit`/`step` can be any expression, not
  just literals. A `step` of `0` is an error rather than an infinite loop.
- Same 1,000,000-iteration safety net as `WHILE`, for a range that never
  reaches its limit.

```
TO countdown
  MAKE "i 5
  FOREVER [
    PRINT :i
    MAKE "i :i - 1
    IF :i < 1 [STOP]
  ]
END
```

- `FOREVER [block]` runs `block` forever — the only way out is `STOP` (or
  a procedure's `OUTPUT`, or `THROW`) inside it, same as any other loop
  body. Useful for a game-loop-style script that runs until some
  in-script condition decides to stop it. Unlike `OUTPUT`, `STOP` works
  directly at the top level too (see "OUTPUT, STOP" below) specifically
  so a bare top-level `FOREVER` has a real way to end, rather than only
  the same 1,000,000-iteration safety net as `WHILE`/`FOR`.

## Output

```
PRINT "hello
PRINT 2 + 2
PRINT :size
PRINT :name
PRINT [hello there, this prints as one line]
```

- `PRINT`/`PR` writes to the history pane (auto-scrolling into view).
- `PRINT "word` prints a single literal word (no spaces — it stops at the
  first whitespace character).
- `PRINT :name` prints a word-typed variable as its text, or a
  numeric-typed variable as a number — whichever it holds.
- `PRINT [words...]` prints a bracketed list as its elements, joined by
  single spaces (any original whitespace inside the brackets is
  collapsed). This is direct, immediate printing — the list isn't
  evaluated as code (unlike a `REPEAT`/`IF`/`WHILE` block) and isn't
  stored anywhere.
- `PRINT <expr>` (anything else) evaluates and prints a numeric
  expression.
- A list's own outer brackets are never shown when it's the thing being
  printed directly (`PRINT [a b]` -> `a b`, not `[a b]`) — but a nested
  sublist **inside** that list does print with its brackets, since
  that's the only way to tell where one element ends and the next
  begins: `PRINT [a [b c] d]` -> `a [b c] d`. The same rule applies no
  matter how the list value was produced — `PRINT FIRST [[1 2] 3]`
  prints `1 2` (no brackets, since the sublist is PRINT's own top-level
  value here), while `PRINT LIST FIRST [[1 2] 3] "x` prints `[1 2] x`
  (bracketed, now that it's nested one level inside the 2-element list
  `LIST` just built).
- `TYPE <expr>` works exactly like `PRINT`, but **without** the trailing
  newline — several `TYPE`s (or a `TYPE` followed by a `PRINT`) build up
  one line of output piece by piece: `TYPE "a` then `TYPE "b` then
  `PRINT "c` prints `abc` on one line, not three.

## Files

```
LOAD "/Users/you/scripts/star.logo
SAVE "/Users/you/scripts/star.logo
```

- `LOAD "path` reads a file and runs its contents as Logo source, exactly
  as if it had been typed into the REPL — including `TO` definitions,
  which is the main use case (write/edit a script externally, `LOAD` it,
  test, repeat).
- `SAVE "path` writes every currently-defined procedure out as `TO ... END`
  Logo source, readable back in by `LOAD`. It only saves procedure
  definitions, not variables, turtle state, or drawing — loading a saved
  file gives you back the same reusable procedures, not a replay of
  everything you typed.
- Both take the path as a single whitespace-delimited word, same as
  `PRINT "word` and `MAKE "name` — a path containing spaces won't parse
  correctly typed this way. Use **File → Open…**/**Save…** in the menu bar
  instead for paths with spaces, since those go through a native file
  picker rather than this text syntax.
- If the file can't be read or written, prints "LOAD: could not read
  file" / "SAVE: could not write file" rather than crashing.

### General file I/O

```
MAKE "ch OPENWRITE "scratch.txt
FILEPRINT :ch SENTENCE "first "line
FILEPRINT :ch SENTENCE "second "line
CLOSE :ch

MAKE "rd OPENREAD "scratch.txt
WHILE NOT EOF? :rd [PRINT READLINE :rd]
CLOSE :rd

MAKE "ap OPENAPPEND "scratch.txt
FILEPRINT :ap SENTENCE "third "line
CLOSE :ap

PRINT MEMBER? "scratch.txt DIRECTORY   -> TRUE
DELETEFILE "scratch.txt
```

Reading or writing arbitrary files — not just procedure definitions the
way `LOAD`/`SAVE` are limited to. Adapted from Terrapin's single
overloaded `OPEN` (plus a mode-flag argument) into three separate,
self-descriptive verbs instead, following this project's own Phase 3
policy of renaming for clarity over matching a dialect exactly.

- `OPENREAD "path` opens a file for reading and outputs a **channel
  number** (a small nonnegative integer) to use with `READLINE`/`EOF?`/
  `CLOSE`, or `-1` if the file doesn't exist (or every channel is
  already in use — there's room for 16 open at once).
- `OPENWRITE "path` opens a fresh, empty channel for `FILEPRINT`.
  Nothing touches disk yet — only `CLOSE` actually writes the file, so
  losing power or crashing before closing loses the data, the same
  tradeoff Terrapin's own `CLOSE` warns about. Outputs a channel number,
  or `-1` if every channel is already in use.
- `OPENAPPEND "path` is `OPENWRITE`, but preloads the file's existing
  content (if any) first, so `CLOSE` writes the combined result back
  instead of replacing it.
- `CLOSE channel` closes a channel opened by any of the three above —
  for a write channel, this is the point the file is actually saved.
  Prints `CLOSE: no such open channel` for an invalid or already-closed
  channel number.
- `FILEPRINT channel thing` converts `thing` to text exactly like
  `PRINT` does (so a list writes out space-separated with no brackets)
  and appends it plus a newline to an open write channel's buffer.
  Prints `FILEPRINT: channel not open for writing` otherwise.
- `READLINE channel` outputs the next line (as a word, newline
  consumed but not included) from an open read channel, or the empty
  word at EOF or on an invalid/closed channel — check `EOF?` first if
  the difference matters.
- `EOF? channel` outputs `TRUE` once a read channel has no more lines
  left (also `TRUE` for an invalid/closed channel).
- `DELETEFILE "path` removes a file from disk. Prints `DELETEFILE:
  could not delete "path` if it doesn't exist or can't be removed.
- `DIRECTORY` outputs every file/subdirectory name in the current
  working directory as a list of words, in whatever order the OS
  returns them.

## Background image

```
LOADPIC "backyard.png
SAVEPIC "with_turtle.png
```

- `LOADPIC "path` loads an image file (any format `gdk-pixbuf` supports —
  PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, and more) as the canvas background, scaled to
  fill it exactly. Drawing (lines, `FILL`, `ERASERECT`, turtles) is
  painted on top of it, same as it would be over the flat
  `SETBACKGROUND` color. It persists across `CLEAR`/`CLEAN` (they only
  erase drawing, not the background) — load a different image, or a
  blank-colored one, to replace it.
- `ERASERECT` always erases back to the flat `SETBACKGROUND` color
  within the rectangle it covers, not back to the loaded image — a
  known, accepted simplification rather than re-compositing that patch
  of the image.
- `SAVEPIC "path` writes the current canvas — background image (if any),
  every line, and every turtle — out as a PNG, regardless of the
  extension given. The same rendering **File → Export as PNG…** uses,
  just reachable from a script instead of the menu.
- Both take the path as a single whitespace-delimited word, same
  convention as `LOAD`/`SAVE` (see above) — use the file-picker menu
  actions instead for a path containing spaces.
- If the file can't be decoded/read or written, prints "LOADPIC: could
  not load "path" / "SAVEPIC: could not save "path" rather than
  crashing.

## Turtle sprites

```
LOADSPRITE "ant "ant.png
SETSPRITE "ant
REPEAT 12 [STAMPSPRITE FD 40 RT 30]
SETSPRITE "NONE
```

- `LOADSPRITE "name "path` loads an image file (any format `gdk-pixbuf`
  supports, same as `LOADPIC`) and registers it under `name`, scaled to
  a fixed 40x40 box. Loading a second image under an existing name
  replaces it.
- `SETSPRITE "name` assigns a previously loaded shape to the current
  turtle, replacing its default triangle everywhere it's drawn — live on
  the canvas and in any later `STAMPSPRITE`. `SETSPRITE "NONE` resets it
  back to the default triangle. Prints `SETSPRITE: no such sprite
  "name` if that name was never `LOADSPRITE`d.
- `STAMPSPRITE` bakes a **permanent** copy of the turtle's current shape
  (its `SETSPRITE` image, or the default triangle) onto the canvas at
  its current position and heading — the turtle keeps moving
  afterward, but the stamped copy stays exactly where it was stamped.
  Same call-time-frozen treatment as `FILL`/`ERASERECT`: a line drawn
  after a `STAMPSPRITE` can't retroactively cover it, and vice versa.
- If `LOADSPRITE` fails (bad path, unrecognized format, or the sprite
  table — 20 entries — is already full), prints `LOADSPRITE: could not
  load "path` rather than crashing.

### Sprite-sheet blit

```
LOADSPRITESHEET "walker "walker.png 4 2
SETSPRITE "walker
FOR [i 0 23] [SETSPRITEFRAME MOD :i 8 STAMPSPRITE FD 20 RT 15]
SETSPRITE "NONE
```

- `LOADSPRITESHEET "name "path cols rows` is `LOADSPRITE`'s sibling for
  loading one image packed with several frames in an even grid — a
  walk-cycle strip, a tile set, anything where only one cell should be
  drawn at a time. It slices the image into `cols` columns by `rows`
  rows of equal-size cells and registers all of them under `name`,
  0-indexed row-major (frame 0 is the top-left cell, reading left to
  right then top to bottom). Both `cols` and `rows` must be at least 1;
  otherwise prints `LOADSPRITESHEET: cols and rows must be at least 1`
  without touching any existing sprite under that name.
- `SETSPRITE` (see above) works the same way for a sheet as for a plain
  image — it assigns the whole grid to the turtle and resets its active
  frame back to 0.
- `SETSPRITEFRAME n` picks which cell of the current turtle's grid is
  shown — live on the canvas and in any later `STAMPSPRITE` — until the
  next `SETSPRITEFRAME` or `SETSPRITE` call. Requires a sprite already
  assigned via `SETSPRITE` (prints `SETSPRITEFRAME: no sprite set (use
  SETSPRITE first)` otherwise) and `n` within that sprite's grid (prints
  `SETSPRITEFRAME: frame out of range` otherwise, `0` to `cols * rows -
  1`). A plain (non-sheet) `LOADSPRITE` image is just a 1x1 grid, so
  `SETSPRITEFRAME 0` is its only valid frame.
- Each cell is scaled independently into the same fixed 40x40 turtle box
  every other sprite uses, so cells don't need to be square — a
  `LOADSPRITESHEET "name "path 4 2` on a 200x100 image slices out
  50x50 cells and scales each one up to 40x40, same as `LOADSPRITE`
  scales a whole image.

### Animated sprites

```
LOADSPRITESHEET "walker "walker.png 4 2
SETSPRITE "walker
ANIMATESPRITE 0.15 24
SETSPRITE "NONE
```

- `ANIMATESPRITE delay frames` plays the current turtle's sprite-sheet
  frames in place, over real time: it advances the active frame by 1
  (wrapping back to 0 at the end of the grid), pauses `delay` seconds,
  and requests a redraw, `frames` times in a row — so each intermediate
  frame is actually visible on screen as it plays, not just the final
  one once the command returns. The turtle doesn't move; combine with
  `FD`/`RT` (and `SETSPRITEFRAME` directly, as in the sprite-sheet blit
  example above) for a walking animation instead of an in-place one.
  `delay` of `0` (or less) skips the pause but still advances every
  frame and redraws, same as `WAIT`'s own zero-or-negative handling.
  Requires a sprite already assigned via `SETSPRITE` — same requirement
  and error message (`ANIMATESPRITE: no sprite set (use SETSPRITE
  first)`) as `SETSPRITEFRAME`.
- Doesn't touch the canvas raster or interact with `STAMPSPRITE` at
  all — it's a live-only turtle-state change over time, same category
  as `SETSPRITEFRAME`. Call `STAMPSPRITE` yourself in between if you
  also want a permanent copy of some frame.

## Resizable canvas

```
SETCANVASSIZE 800 400
PRINT CANVASSIZE
```

- `SETCANVASSIZE width height` changes the canvas's size at runtime
  (Terrapin's `SETEXTENT`, renamed for clarity). Both must be within
  50–4000; otherwise prints `SETCANVASSIZE: width and height must be
  50-4000` and leaves the current size untouched.
- On success, it resets the canvas the same way `CLEAR`/`CS` does —
  every line, fill, and stamp is erased, and every turtle goes back to
  home — since none of that fits a canvas of a different size. Home
  itself moves too: it's always the current canvas's center
  (`width / 2`, `height / 2`), not a fixed point, so `HOME` and a fresh
  turtle both land in the right place after a resize.
- `CANVASSIZE` reads the current size back as a `[width height]` list,
  the same 2-element-list convention as `POS`. Starts at `500 500`.
- `WRAP`/`FENCE`'s boundary and a background image loaded via `LOADPIC`
  both follow the current canvas size — resizing recomputes the
  wrap/fence edges immediately, and drops any loaded background image
  (it was scaled to the old size and wouldn't fit the new one; load it
  again with `LOADPIC` afterward if you still want it).

## Debugger

```
TO spiral :size
  IF :size > 200 [STOP]
  FD :size
  RT 91
  IF :size = 50 [BACKTRACE PAUSE]
  spiral :size + 2
END

PRINT EXECTIME [spiral 10]
```

- `PAUSE` halts the running script right where it's called and waits —
  the app stays fully responsive, so you can type other commands into
  the entry box while paused, including reading or changing any global
  variable, or a paused procedure's own `:parameter`s (variable lookup
  already searches whichever calls are currently active, paused or
  not). Nothing resumes until a matching `CONTINUE`. Nested `PAUSE`s
  stack — each `CONTINUE` resumes only the innermost one.
- `CONTINUE`/`CO` resumes the innermost active `PAUSE`. Prints
  `CONTINUE: nothing is paused` if nothing is currently paused.
- `BACKTRACE`/`BT` prints the current call stack, innermost call first,
  ending with `(top level)`.
- `EXECTIME thing` runs a word/list as Logo source, the same as `RUN`,
  and returns how long that took in microseconds — instead of trying to
  capture the executed code's own result, since (like `RUN`/`APPLY`)
  that's deliberately not something this interpreter's commands hand
  back. If the executed code itself calls `PAUSE`, the time it spent
  paused counts too, same as any other wall-clock duration.
- `PAUSE` only actually pauses when running in the real app — there's
  no live entry box to ever call `CONTINUE` from the headless test
  driver, so it's a silent no-op there instead of waiting forever.

(Renamed as little as possible from Terrapin's own `PAUSE`/`CONTINUE`
(`CO`)/`BACKTRACE` (`BT`)/`EXECTIME` — these names were already clear.)

## Interactive input

```
TO drive
  MAKE "key WAITKEY
  WHILE MEMBER? :key [Up Down Left Right] [
    IF :key = "Up [FD 20]
    IF :key = "Down [BK 20]
    IF :key = "Left [LT 15]
    IF :key = "Right [RT 15]
    MAKE "key WAITKEY
  ]
END
```

An event loop like this needs `WHILE`, not a procedure calling itself:
`WHILE`'s loop body doesn't consume a real call-stack level per
iteration the way a procedure call does (it's capped at 1,000,000
iterations instead — see `MAX_WHILE_ITERATIONS`), so it can run for as
many keypresses as it takes. A self-recursive version of `drive` would
run into the ordinary 200-deep recursion cap (`Recursion too deep, call
ignored`) after 200 keypresses and simply stop responding.

- `WAITKEY` halts the running script right where it's called and waits
  for a real keypress in the entry box, then outputs its name as a
  word — `"a"`, `"Up"`, `"Return"`, `"space"`, whatever GDK's own
  key-name lookup gives back, unfiltered. This intercepts the *very
  next* keypress no matter what it is — even `Return`/`Up`/`Down`,
  which would otherwise submit the entry box or navigate command
  history — so it works as an answer to `WAITKEY` instead.
- Same PAUSE-style protocol otherwise: the app stays fully responsive
  while waiting, and `WAITKEY` only actually waits when running in the
  real app — no live entry box in the headless test driver means no
  key to ever press, so it returns the empty word immediately there
  instead of waiting forever.
- This is Phase 4's foundational feature: `eval_logo` running
  synchronously start-to-finish means anything that needs to pause a
  running script and wait on a live event shares the same underlying
  mechanism `PAUSE`/`CONTINUE` already established (see "Debugger"
  above) — `WAITKEY` just applies it to a keypress instead of a typed
  command.

```
PRINT 'What is your name?'
MAKE "name INPUT
PRINT SENTENCE "Hello :name

PRINT 'Type a few words, separated by spaces:'
MAKE "words PARSE INPUT
```

- `INPUT` is `WAITKEY`'s other half: it halts the script and waits for
  a full **line** — typed into the entry box and submitted with Enter —
  rather than a single keypress, and outputs it as a word (spaces and
  all, same as a `'raw text'` literal), not Logo source and not a list.
  `PARSE INPUT` is how to split it into a list of words, the same way
  `PARSE` already does for any other value.
- While waiting, ordinary typing works exactly as normal (composing the
  line to submit) — only Return/Enter is special-cased, capturing the
  whole entry box as raw text instead of running it as a command, and
  doing so unconditionally (no multi-line composing, no Shift+Enter for
  a literal newline — `INPUT` always reads exactly one line).
- Same silent-no-op convention as `WAITKEY`/`PAUSE`: only actually waits
  in the real app, since there's no live entry box in the headless test
  driver to ever type a line into.

```
TO followmouse
  WHILE NOT BUTTON? [SETXY MOUSEX MOUSEY]
END

TO drivewithjoystick
  ; Stands still, pointing wherever the stick is aimed -- only moves
  ; while button 0 is held (button 1 stops it). Turning *and* moving
  ; every iteration with no pacing sends the turtle flying off in a
  ; straight line almost instantly, even with the stick centered
  ; (axis near 0): FD still runs every single spin of the loop, as
  ; fast as the loop can go. WAIT paces this to about 20 steps/second.
  WHILE NOT JOYSTICKBUTTON? 1 [
    SETHEADING JOYSTICKAXIS 0 * 1.8
    IF JOYSTICKBUTTON? 0 [FD 5]
    WAIT 0.05
  ]
END
```

Same `WHILE`-not-recursion reasoning as `drive` above applies here too
— these are meant to keep running for as long as it takes the user to
click or press the button, which could easily be more than 200 frames.

- `MOUSEPOS` outputs `[x y]` — the current mouse position over the
  canvas, in the same pixel coordinate space `POS`/`SETXY` already use
  (origin top-left). `MOUSEX`/`MOUSEY` read just one coordinate,
  matching `GETX`/`GETY`'s own precedent. `BUTTON?` outputs `TRUE`
  while any mouse button is held down over the canvas — not tied to a
  specific button or position, matching Terrapin's own `BUTTON`.
- Unlike `WAITKEY`/`INPUT`, none of these ever pause the script — they're
  a **passive** query, not something that waits on a live event. Before
  the mouse has ever moved over the canvas, `MOUSEPOS` reads `0 0`.
- `JOYSTICK?` outputs `TRUE` once any joystick/game controller is
  connected. `JOYSTICKAXIS n` reads stick axis `n` (0 is typically the
  first stick's horizontal axis, 1 its vertical one — however many axes
  a given controller has), normalized to **-100 to 100** rather than
  the raw hardware range, the same "friendlier units" preference as
  `WAIT`'s seconds or `ANIMATESPRITE`'s plain frame counts.
  `JOYSTICKBUTTON? n` reads button `n`, 0-indexed. All three read `0`/
  `FALSE` rather than erroring if nothing is connected — same
  "expected, not a mistake" treatment `EOF?` gives a closed file
  channel — and, like the mouse operators above, never pause.
- Every one of these seven operators queues a redraw and processes any
  pending window-system events (motion, clicks, the redraw just
  queued) before it reads anything, the same technique `WAIT`/`PAUSE`/
  `WAITKEY` already use for their own busy-waits, just a single pass
  instead of a loop. This matters more than it looks like it should —
  a `WHILE` loop built only around these (like `followmouse`/
  `drivewithjoystick` above) runs as one long `eval_logo` call that
  never otherwise returns to GTK's own main loop, and GTK only ever
  fires the canvas's motion/click signals — or actually repaints
  anything a turtle-moving command drew — when it gets to run an
  iteration of that loop. Without this, two separate things would go
  wrong: `mouse_x`/`mouse_y`/`mouse_button_down` would stay frozen at
  whatever they were the *moment the loop started* (the loop would just
  spin until `WHILE`'s own 1,000,000-iteration safety cap cut it off,
  reporting `WHILE: stopped after too many iterations` instead of ever
  seeing the state it was waiting for), and even once that's fixed, the
  turtle would only ever visibly jump to its *final* position once the
  whole loop ends, instead of tracking the mouse/joystick as it happens
  — both found and fixed the same day (2026-08-08).
- Phase 4's one genuinely new dependency: joystick/game-controller
  input needs SDL2 (linked alongside GTK — see the Makefile), the only
  place in this codebase that isn't GTK/Cairo/GLib. `interpreter.c`
  itself still never touches SDL directly, reaching it only through
  the same kind of callback `LOADPIC`/`resize_canvas`/etc. already use.

## Sound

```
TONE 440 0.3       ; play a 440Hz tone for 0.3 seconds
PLAYSOUND "click.wav
STOPSOUND
```

- `TONE frequency seconds` synthesizes and plays a sine wave at
  `frequency` Hz for `seconds` seconds. `PLAYSOUND "path` loads and
  plays a WAV file from disk instead — same `"path` convention as
  `LOADPIC`/`SAVEPIC` (a quoted word, not a general string expression).
  `STOPSOUND` silences whatever either one is still playing.
- Both `TONE` and `PLAYSOUND` are **fire-and-forget**, unlike
  `WAITKEY`/`INPUT`/`PAUSE` above: they queue the sound and return
  immediately rather than blocking the script until it finishes. A
  sound effect can play in the background while a `WHILE`-driven
  animation (`followmouse`, `drivewithjoystick`) keeps moving the
  turtle — the way a real game engine's sound effects work, not a
  blocking beep.
- Only one sound plays at a time: a `TONE`/`PLAYSOUND` while another is
  still queued/playing replaces it outright rather than queueing up
  behind it (both clear the device's queue first), same as
  `STOPSOUND`'s own effect.
- `PLAYSOUND` reports `PLAYSOUND: could not load "path` if the file
  doesn't exist or isn't a WAV file SDL2 can decode; `TONE`/`STOPSOUND`
  never fail outright — a bad frequency/duration (zero or negative)
  just plays nothing.
- No new dependency beyond SDL2 (already linked for the joystick
  above): its own audio device queue is all a synthesized tone or a
  WAV file playback needs, so this reuses Phase 4's one "genuinely
  new" library rather than adding another. `interpreter.c` still never
  touches SDL directly, reaching it only through the same kind of
  callback `LOADPIC`/`JOYSTICK?`/etc. already use — silent no-ops in
  the headless test driver, where there's no audio device to open.

## Errors

Malformed input reports an error message to the history pane rather than
silently doing nothing (or, in one case that's now fixed, crashing):

- An unrecognized command prints `I don't know how to <NAME>`.
- `TO` without a matching `END` prints `TO <name>: missing END` and stops
  processing the rest of that input, rather than running the dangling body
  as top-level commands.
- `REPEAT`, `WHILE`, `IF`, and `IFELSE` each print `<COMMAND>: expected [
  block ]` if the bracketed block is missing, unterminated (no matching
  `]`), or too long to fit the interpreter's internal buffer (4KB — see
  below). `IFELSE` additionally prints `IFELSE: expected two [ block ]s`
  if only one block is given (`IF` doesn't require a second block;
  `IFELSE` does). A bracketed list literal used as a value anywhere
  (`PRINT [...]`, `MAKE "name [...]`, an argument to `FIRST`/`FPUT`/etc.)
  prints `[ list ]: missing closing ] or too long` if it's unterminated
  or oversized, rather than silently treated as ending at the input's
  end. A `'raw text'` literal is the same story: `'...': missing
  closing ' or too long` if it's unterminated or oversized.
- `MAKE`, `ERASE`, `SHOW`, `LOAD`, `SAVE`, `LOADPIC`, `SAVEPIC`,
  `LOADSPRITE`, `LOADSPRITESHEET`, and `SETSPRITE` each print
  `<COMMAND>: expected a "name`/`"path` if the required quoted word is
  missing. `ERASE`/`SHOW` also print `<COMMAND>: no such procedure
  "<name>` if the name isn't defined; `SETSPRITE` similarly prints
  `SETSPRITE: no such sprite "<name>` if it wasn't `LOADSPRITE`d/
  `LOADSPRITESHEET`d. `SETSPRITEFRAME` prints `SETSPRITEFRAME: no sprite
  set (use SETSPRITE first)` with no sprite assigned, or
  `SETSPRITEFRAME: frame out of range` outside its sprite's grid.
  `ANIMATESPRITE` prints the same "no sprite set" message (as
  `ANIMATESPRITE: no sprite set (use SETSPRITE first)`) under the same
  condition.
- `SETCANVASSIZE` prints `SETCANVASSIZE: width and height must be
  50-4000` if either argument is outside that range, leaving the
  canvas's current size untouched.
- `CONTINUE`/`CO` prints `CONTINUE: nothing is paused` if there's no
  active `PAUSE` to resume.
- `CLOSE`, `FILEPRINT`, and `DELETEFILE` print `CLOSE: no such open
  channel`, `FILEPRINT: channel not open for writing`, and
  `DELETEFILE: could not delete "<path>` respectively, on a bad
  channel/path; `OPENREAD`/`OPENWRITE`/`OPENAPPEND` report failure by
  returning `-1` instead (no message), matching the rest of this
  interpreter's operators.
- `TO <name>: procedure body too long, not defined` if a procedure's body
  exceeds the interpreter's internal buffer (8KB).
- `TO <name>: too many parameters, extra parameters ignored` if more than
  8 (`MAX_PARAMS`) are declared — the procedure is still defined, using
  only the first 8.
- `MAKE: too many variables defined, not set` if the global variable
  table (100 entries) is full and `MAKE "name` would need to create a
  new one — an existing variable can still be updated either way.
- Recursion past ~2000 nested calls prints `Recursion too deep, call
  ignored` (see Variables & scoping above); a `WHILE` past 1,000,000
  iterations prints `WHILE: stopped after too many iterations`.
- `WORD` prints `WORD: expected words, not a list` if given a list
  argument, rather than silently flattening its structure into text (see
  "List construction" above). `FPUT`/`LPUT` print the analogous `FPUT:
  can't add a list to a word` / `LPUT: can't add a list to a word` if
  `thing` is a list and `list` is a word.
- `ITEM` prints `ITEM: index out of range` if given an index less than 1
  or past the end of its list/word argument, rather than an empty result
  or an unchecked out-of-bounds read.
- `APPLY` prints `APPLY: no such procedure "name` if given an undefined
  procedure name, or `APPLY: wrong number of inputs for procedure "name`
  if its list's element count doesn't match the procedure's parameter
  count. `RUN` prints `RUN: too deeply nested, ignored` for a
  self-referential `RUN` (see "Deferred execution" above).
- `CATCH` prints `CATCH: expected [ block ]` if its bracketed block is
  missing, unterminated, or too long. `THROW` with no matching `CATCH`
  anywhere prints `THROW: no CATCH found for "tag` and execution recovers
  at the next top-level command, rather than aborting the rest of the
  running script (see "CATCH, THROW" above).
- `DOT` prints `DOT: expected two lists` if either argument isn't a
  list, or `DOT: lists must be the same length` if their lengths differ.
  `CROSS` prints `CROSS: expected two 3-element lists` if either
  argument isn't a list with exactly 3 elements (see "DOT, CROSS"
  above).
- `ARRAY` prints `ARRAY: size must be at least 1` for a size less than
  1. `SETITEM` prints `SETITEM: expected an array` if not given an
  array, `SETITEM: index out of range` for an out-of-bounds index, or
  `SETITEM: can't store an array inside an array` if `value` is itself
  an array (see "Arrays" above).
- Every internal text buffer (procedure bodies, block bodies, words,
  variable values, file paths, REPL history entries) is fixed-size but
  generously sized for normal use; input that would overflow one is
  rejected with an error above rather than silently truncated. List
  storage works the same way: every list element in the program (across
  every list, including sublists) comes from one fixed-size pool
  (8192 elements); building a list once it's full prints `list storage
  full, list operation ignored` instead of overflowing.

What's still silent: a word that doesn't start with a number, used where
a number is expected, reads as `0` rather than erroring (see Words
above), and any parse error inside a numeric expression itself (an
unparseable expression just evaluates to `0`, same as always) — see
"Known limitations" below.

## Interface

- Commands are typed into the entry box at the bottom of the REPL pane.
- Enter runs the input **once it's complete** — brackets are balanced and
  every `TO` has a matching `END`. A single-line command like `FD 100`
  always runs immediately. A `TO ... END` procedure (or anything with an
  unclosed `[`) keeps accepting new lines, growing the box, until it
  balances out — then the whole thing runs at once. This means you can
  type a multi-line procedure definition one line at a time, the same way
  most Logo REPLs handle it.
- Shift+Enter always inserts a newline without submitting, regardless of
  whether the input is complete.
- **Up/Down arrow** recall previously-submitted history (each submission —
  even a multi-line `TO ... END` — is one entry), same as a shell. They
  only trigger recall when the cursor is on the entry's first line (Up) or
  last line (Down); otherwise they move the cursor normally, so browsing
  within a recalled multi-line block still works. Whatever you'd typed but
  not yet submitted is preserved and restored once you browse back down
  past the newest entry.
- **Bracket matching**: whenever the cursor touches a `[` or `]` (on
  either side of it), that bracket and its match are highlighted. A
  bracket with no match — e.g. `REPEAT 4 [FD 10` with no closing `]` — is
  flagged in a different color instead. This is in the entry box only,
  not the history pane.
- **Syntax highlighting**: as you type, commands (built-in ones like
  `REPEAT`/`FD`/`MAKE`, and calls to your own `TO`/`END` procedures) are
  colored one way, numbers another, `:variables` another, and `"word`
  literals another. Re-evaluated on every keystroke against the current
  set of defined procedures — this is a separate, lightweight scan, not
  the real interpreter, so it only classifies text for coloring and
  doesn't validate it. Also entry-box only.
- The **File** menu has **Open…** (⌘O), which picks a file via a native
  dialog and runs it the same way `LOAD` does; **Save…** (⌘S), which does
  the same for `SAVE`; **Export as PNG…** (⌘E), which renders the current
  canvas (background, drawn lines, and the turtle) to an image file at the
  canvas's actual pixel size; and **Quit** (⌘Q), which closes the app. The
  menu bar holding these is the system-wide one at the top of the screen on
  macOS and an in-window bar on Linux, and every ⌘ shortcut listed here and
  below is **Ctrl** on Linux — ⌘O is Ctrl+O, ⌘⇧I is Ctrl+Shift+I, and so
  on.
- The **View** menu has Increase/Decrease/Reset Text Size, applied to both
  the history pane and the entry box, and a
  **Show Input Window** checkbox (⌘⇧I) that hides the whole history
  pane/entry box, leaving the canvas alone — useful for a
  presentation/demo mode. The canvas expands to fill the freed space;
  toggling it back on restores the original split.
- **Ctrl+C**, typed in the terminal this app was launched from, interrupts
  whatever script is currently running — prints `Interrupted.` and stops,
  however deeply nested in loops or procedure calls, rather than the
  default behavior of killing the whole app outright. The app itself
  keeps running afterward, ready for the next command, exactly as if the
  interrupted script had reached its own natural end. This is the one
  way to get a script's attention while it's running at all: `eval_logo`
  runs synchronously start-to-finish, so short of this, a script with a
  runaway loop (or one that's simply taking a very long time) can't be
  stopped except by quitting the app entirely.
- **`bin/logomotive --headless script.logo`** runs with no window at all,
  for scripting/automation rather than interactive use: `PRINT` output
  goes to stdout, the process exits when the script finishes (0 on
  success; 1 if the file can't be read or fails to parse, or if a
  `THROW` reached the top level with no `CATCH`, even though the rest
  of the script still ran), and every suspend point resolves instantly instead of
  pausing for real time — `WAIT`/`SETSPEED`'s own throttle/`PAUSE`
  resume immediately, `ANIMATESPRITE` resolves every frame in one tight
  loop, and `LAUNCH`'s concurrent agents run to completion via the same
  synchronous scheduler they always use (no real GTK timer was ever
  involved there in the first place). `WAITKEY`/`INPUT` read a real
  line from stdin (EOF resolves to an empty word/line rather than
  hanging) — `WAITKEY` uses the whole line as its "key name", so piping
  in `space` satisfies `WAITKEY = "space`, a deliberate simplification
  of genuine single-keypress capture that headless mode's own batch-use
  case doesn't need. `LOADSPRITE`/`LOADSPRITESHEET` are silent no-ops
  (same as every other headless/test entry point in this codebase —
  there's no window to decode an image into), so anything depending on
  a loaded sprite (`SETSPRITE`, `ANIMATESPRITE`) reports its ordinary
  "no such sprite"/"no sprite set" error if attempted.
- **`bin/logomotive -h` / `--help`** prints the full command-line option
  list (`--speed`, `--headless`, the optional `script.logo` argument)
  and exits immediately, before GTK/GApplication is ever touched.

## Known limitations (intentional, permanent design choices)

- A word that doesn't start with a number, used where a number is
  expected, silently coerces to `0` rather than erroring — see "Errors"
  above.
- The multi-line input's completeness check only balances `[`/`]` and counts
  `TO`/`END` — it doesn't validate the syntax inside, so e.g. a stray `]`
  can make an otherwise-valid input submit early.
